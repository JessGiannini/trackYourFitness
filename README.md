## Getting Started

To explore this application you will need to install a few npm packages and start the server. As well as MongoDB.

### Prerequisites

Here is a step by step walk through to install [MongoDB](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb).

### Installing

After installing the MongoDB software follow these steps to get the server started and download the correct npm packages. Use your terminal and enter the following commands.

Install all npm packages according to the package.json:

```
npm i
```

Be sure to check the package.json for all of these requirements:

```
    "express": "^4.16.3",
    "mongo": "^0.1.0",
    "mongojs": "^3.1.0",
    "mongoose": "^5.3.16",
    "morgan": "^1.9.1"
```

Check to see if Mongo is running:

```
mongo
```

Then start the server:

```
node server.js
```
